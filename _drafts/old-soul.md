"Old Soul" This is what my wife calls me. I don't know how to take it. It makes me happy and sad at the same time. I like to think it means I have an understanding of the world that is greater than my age should allow for. She says I had to grow up fast and to that I won't lie. I don't really think about my childhood because I don't think I ever really had one. Responsibility was something that was handed to be at a very young age. Part of that I'm sure is just normal farm kid upbringing, but there always feels like more to it. 

My biological parents separated when I was 2 years old and finally divorced when I was 4. When I think about it the only real reason my parents divorced was because my dad wanted to get remarried. If it hadn't been for that who knows how long he would have waited. I'm sure if mom had tried to remarry first he would have fought tooth and nail to prevent it, but that is just speculation. I can't really know since it never happened. My father is not a vengeful person so maybe I'm over dramatizing the situation. 

My "childhood" was a series of happy childish weekends intertwined with work and school. The only real time I got to be a kid was the 2 weekends a month I visited my mom. The rest of the time I had chores and responsibilities on the farm. I did have plenty of opportunity to play when I was growing up, just never had time to feel like a kid. I was always an outsider everywhere I went. That feeling of being on the outside still persists today and is very hard to shake off. It causes me to distance myself from everyone around me. To them it may look like I'm hard but in reality I'm very weak and don't want to let anyone see that weakness. 

This too goes to the social pressures I feel on myself. The "Man of the House." I've been that for a long time. I have to provide everything for my family and to that extent I do, but I don't provide much in the way of emotional openness. I fear that my lack of emotional knowledge could negatively affect my children. I see the shyness in Olive and I want to help her fix that but it's hard when I am shy myself. It's something I know I have to work on but sometimes it's just easier to leave work to Kelli, although I know that isn't fair. 

Women in this world have been mistreated for a long time and I want my daughter to feel like a foreigner to that treatment. I want to raise her to be a strong independent person. I want her to embrace her femininity and draw strength from it. She's not a man and I don't ever expect her to act like one. I often feel that is how men look at the equality issue, they think Women just need to be more man-like. I would say that is completely wrong, in fact 180 degrees wrong. I believe then Men need to be more Women-like. 

Women have an amazing ability for empathy and emotion than for some reason society has beaten out of the image of a "Real Man." We're told from a very early age, Don't Cry, Man Up, Suck it up Pussy, You're acting like a little girl!

That last one is extremely demeaning on many fronts. Firstly of course is that it says little girls are not strong, and I can honestly say that my 17 month old daughter already has incredible strength. She does things every day that simply amaze me, not because I don't think she should be able to do them but because she does them with such skill and finesse. The other side of it is that this statement implies that a little boy acting like a little girl is for some reason a bad thing, and this idea is just plane wrong (see previous thoughts.) 

So what is the answer? Well I'll be honest I don't know, like I said there is plenty of joy and sadness in this life of mine and I wouldn't change it for anything. The events of my past have forged me into the person I am today, and yes forge is the correct word there. I am a rigid piece of steel, I try to bend but I fear that too much might break me. But if I can bend just right I might find a way to change my form into something different, something better. It will all just take time.
