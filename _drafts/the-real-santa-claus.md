I have a story to tell. Something that happened to me this year that changed me forever. I'll just admit this now and get it out of the way, but I don't believe in Santa Claus. At least I didn't believe in him until this year, when something amazing happened. 

For all my life I was told the story of Santa and how he came down the chimney, through the fireplace and into the livining room or den. Once inside he leaves presents for the good children and coal for those who are bad. There is a problem with this story however, and it something that I've struggled with my whole life, I've never lived anywhere with a fireplace. 

Friends have told me that he magically creates a chimeny and fireplace on those houses that don't have one, but I could just never believe this. There is just too many issues with this sort of entry system. For instance, the structural integretay of the house comes into issue. What if his magical fireplace messes up the house. I mean I understand it's magic but that's the biggest issue, I don't believe in magic. 

I trust that Santa has a higher understanding of the laws of the universe and to us that might look like magic. But creating a fireplace in someones house just to use it as an entrance doesn't work out for me. 

What I'd like to tell you now is something wonderful that happened to me and made me a believer in Santa Claus. The main reason I believe is because I've met him now, after so many years trying to see him I finally met his this year. Not only did I meat him but he stayed around and talked with me. You see, he wasn't in any kind of hurry because he didn't need to be. He has a very strong understanding of space and time and so to him time is fairly irrelivant. 

The amazing thing I have to tell you isn't that I talked with Santa Claus, but instead I know how he enters your house and I can honestly say there is no fireplace involved. No, no fireplace at all. In fact you'd probably laugh at me if I told you the truth but I'll tell it anyway. The Christmas Tree, that is how he get into the house. 

I was sitting up around midnight patiently waiting for Santa like I've done many times in the past. The light on the tree had been turned off for the night so they didn't accidentally overheat or short out and cause a fire. When suddenly the lights on the tree snapped on and there was a faint glown from inside the tree. The glow started to grow and eventually a small doorway or sorts seemed to appear. It was striped like a candy cane and was approximatly 5 feet tall. The most amazing thing about this whole process was that it was completely silent, not even the dog woke up and she's jumps up to the slightest noise. 

The door opened a there he was, Santa Claus, the big man himself. Although he wasn't that big, that's the other bit of fiction about him. He's actually a quite fit man, I mean he has to live forever and you can't exactly do that with Type 2 diabetes and high colestorol that comes with obesity. He was rather short though, just below 5 feet explaning why the doorway was so small. 

As he step through into my living room and doorway behind him dimmed he didn't seem suprised to see me. In fact it's almost as if he was expecting me. 

I asked him, "Aren't I suppose to be asleep or something before you can come?"

"Sure!" came a warm baritone voice. "Usually that is the case but occasionally I have to bend the rules so that the story of me can go on. You see I've selected you to be the one to update my story and correct some of the aged information about me and my methods."

"First off, I do have Raindeer but I haven't used them in decades. They are happy to pull the sleigh but with the ever increasing number of children in the world the Raindeer just aren't fast enough anymore. Don't worry though, I still get them out for their excersize and I make a symbolic run to keep the boys at NORAD busy tracking me. I think they'd get upset if I didn't show up."

I asked him, "Symbolic run? You mean that flight that they track isn't really you out delivering presents?"

"Heavens no." He chuckled a little. "You see that run is my first one of the night, if you understand Quantum mechanics enough you'll realize that I can be in many places at the same time as long as I don't try to run into myself. Why I could spend all night here with you and still have plenty of time to get my deliveries done, in fact that is part of my plan."

"You're going to spend all night here?" I asked him with a twisted look on my face. 

"Well as much times as is needed anyway. Look at the clock on the wall." He said gesturing toward the digital clock I had in the living room. I stared in disbeleif, "That's not possible!" I said emphatically. 

The clock had stopped at exactly 12:37am. 

"Sure it is." He said with a sly grin on his face. "All it takes is to create a small bubble universe around your house and pull it out of normal space time for a few minutes. Just because you don't understand how to do something doesn't mean it's impossible."

"You see, the trick is the tree. I'm able to build a quantum bridge between my workshop and every Christmas tree in the world. I then use these bridges to pop each house into a bubble universe for a few minutes, thus slowing time for the whole universe and giving me as much time as i need in that one house."
